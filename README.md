# Syracuse-Crime-Analysis
This analysis explains the programmatic and manual steps taken to retrieve Syracuse crime data from 2016 to present, including manual batch geocoding via US Census. The repository contains the raw data, an R script containing cleaning and analysis for 55 Syracuse census tracts, a README.md containing a step-by-step guide to the data collection and analysis methodology, and a CodeBook.md containing units, variable definitions, variable transformations, and notable shortcomings for future improvement.
